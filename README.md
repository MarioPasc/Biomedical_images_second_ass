# Biomedical_images_second_assignment

This repository contains all the code I've written for the second assignment of the course 'Biomedical Images'. The code is primarily written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) and focuses on various image processing techniques using kernels, such as lowpass filters, highpass filter, edge detection using Sobel, Prewitt, Canny, etc.

I created this repository as a reference for myself, in case I need to make changes or consult the code in the future. Feel free to explore and provide feedback.
